Chat Application
===============

This is a chat application written in Java for my CSE 110 (Software Engineering) class at UCSD. Worked in a group of 8 people where we followed an Agile development process consisting of three iterations and two milestones. The application utilizes ActiveMQ framework as the broker, and Spring framework for the messaging service. I worked on the client, server, and command line interface.
